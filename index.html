      <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
     React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.
   </li> 
    <li>
Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.</li></ul>

          <p>Prerequisites:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
Familiarity with the core HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages, knowledge of the terminal/command line.</li>
<li>
React uses an HTML-in-JavaScript syntax called JSX (JavaScript and XML). Familiarity with both HTML and JavaScript will help you to learn JSX, and better identify whether bugs in your application are related to JavaScript or to the more specific domain of React. </li>

        Before we can make a component, we should create a new file for it. In fact, we should make a directory just for our components. The following commands make a components directory and then, within that, a file called Todo.js. Make sure you're in the root of your app before you run these!</p>
        <p>Since we're going to make a component called Todo, you can start adding the code for that to Todo.js too, as follows. In this code, we define the function and export it on the same line:</p>
      <code>export default function Todo() {
  return (

  );
        }</code>
      <p>This is OK so far, but our component has to return something! Go back to src/App.js, copy the first < li > from inside the unordered list, and paste it into Todo.js so that it reads like this:</p>
      <code>export default function Todo() {
  return (
    < li className="todo stack-small">
      < div className=" c-cb ">
        < input id=" todo-0 " type="checkbox" defaultChecked = { true } />
        < label className="todo-label" htmlFor= " todo-0 " >
          Eat
        < /label >
      < /div >
      < div className= " btn-group " >
        < button type = " button " className= " btn " >
          Edit < span className = " visually-hidden " >Eat< / span >
        < /button>
        < button type = "button" className= " btn btn__danger " >
          Delete <span className= " visually-hidden " >Eat</span>
        < /button >
      < /div>
    < /li>
  );
        }</code>
      <p>Our Todo component is complete, at least for now; now we can use it. In App.js, add the following line near the top of the file to import Todo:</p>

        <code>import Todo from "./components/Todo";</code>
<p>With this component imported, you can replace all of the < li > elements in App.js with <Todo /> component calls. Your < ul > should read like this:</p>
<code>
< ul
  role="list"
  className="todo-list stack-large stack-exception"
  aria-labelledby="list-heading"
>
  < Todo />
  < Todo />
  < Todo />
  < /ul></code>

      <article>
        <p>If you've only written vanilla JavaScript before now, you might be used to having a separate JavaScript file, where you query for some DOM nodes and attach listeners to them. For example:</p>
        <code>const btn = document.querySelector('button');

btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
  alert("hi!");
          });</code>
        <p>In React, we write event handlers directly on the elements in our JSX, like this:</p>
        <code> 
            < button
  type="button"
  onClick={() => alert("hi!")}
>
  Say hi!
          < /button ></code>
          <p>The onClick attribute has special meaning here: it tells React to run a given function when the user clicks on the button. There are a couple of other things to note:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The camel-cased nature of onClick is important — JSX will not recognize onclick (again, it is already used in JavaScript for a specific purpose, which is related but different — standard onclick handler properties).</li>
    <li>All browser events follow this format in JSX – on, followed by the name of the event.</li></ul>

          <article>
            <p>So far, we've used props to pass data through our components and this has served us just fine. Now that we're dealing with user input and data updates, however, we need something more.</p>

<p>For one thing, props come from the parent of a component. Our < Form /> will not be inheriting a new name for our task; our < input />  element lives directly inside of < Form />, so < Form/> will be directly responsible for creating that new name. We can't ask < Form /> to spontaneously create its own props, but we can ask it to track some of its own data for us. Data such as this, which a component itself owns, is called state. State is another powerful tool for React because components not only own state, but can update it later. It's not possible to update the props a component receives; only to read them.</p>

<p>React provides a variety of special functions that allow us to provide new capabilities to components, like state. These functions are called hooks, and the useState hook, as its name implies, is precisely the one we need in order to give our component some state.</p>

<p>To use a React hook, we need to import it from the react module. In Form.js, change your very first line so that it reads like this:</p>
     <code>
       import React, { useState } from "react";</code>
            <p>This allows us to import the useState() function by itself, and utilize it anywhere in this file.</p>

<p>useState() creates a piece of state for a component, and its only parameter determines the initial value of that state. It returns two things: the state, and a function that can be used to update the state later.</p>
